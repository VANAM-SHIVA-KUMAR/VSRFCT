                    <p className="leading-relaxed">Our free tuition program for children from Class I to Class X is designed to enhance the quality of education for underprivileged students. We provide after-school assistance in all school subjects and strive to instill the values of honesty, cleanliness, and healthy habits. We maintain a teacher-student ratio of 1:10 to ensure every child gets the attention they deserve.</p>

                <TimelineItem title="The Transformation">
                     <p className="leading-relaxed">Before this program, many children would play on the streets after school, without discipline or guidance. Now, they come to our center clean, disciplined, and ready to learn. They have a safe and quiet place to study, with teachers to clear their doubtsâ€”a stark contrast to the conditions at home for many, where parents (mostly maids and casual laborers) lack the time and resources to help.</p>
